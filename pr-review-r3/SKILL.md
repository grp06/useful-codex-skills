  Identify risks, resolve blockers, and produce the final implementation plan.
  Use when assessing PR risks, checking for blockers, or creating an implementation plan.
---

Identify risks and ambiguities (compatibility, reliability, edge cases, rollout). For each, make a decision and state your reasoning.

Identify anything that blocks merging. For each blocker, provide a concrete resolution.

Output a single final plan: ordered steps to make this PR ready to land. If nothing needs to change, state that explicitly.

Do not ask for feedback or clarification. Be decisive. If anything is ambiguous, state your interpretation and proceed.
