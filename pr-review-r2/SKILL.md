  Evaluate PR implementation for simplicity and correctness.

Evaluate the implementation approach. Is it the simplest correct solution? Call out any overengineering, unnecessary abstraction, or avoidable complexity. Propose a simpler or more efficient alternative if one exists, with specific changes.

Do not ask for feedback or clarification. Be decisive. If anything is ambiguous, state your interpretation and proceed.
